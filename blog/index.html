    <h2>The Favorite</h2>

	Setting up the background for the story will add to the richness of the film. With a war between the British and French as a backdrop, the story focuses on the relationship of Queen Anne and Weiss, the court’s favorite. Queen Anne seems to be losing herself. She doubts herself, it falling ill and becoming a mad queen. Weiss, being a close friend and confident, is the only one close enough to tell the queen how it is and in a brutally honest way. You can tell that this relationship has a very strong foundation.

    Enter Abigail Fletcher, played by Emma Stone, the distant cousin of Weiss, who is greeted at the door of the palace covered in mud after being thrown from her carriage. It would be an understatement to say that Fletcher was down on her luck. She coming from a similar background as Weiss, comes from nothing like it now. She has lost her Ladyship, due to her idiotic father’s gambling, a man that she continues to try to protect. But this little piece of information will be vital to understanding what drives her to do the things that she does. She simply wants back what was taking away from her. We learn that she can be as manipulative and conniving as Weiss.

    This leads to the main drama of the film. The competition between Fletcher and Weiss on being the court
    favorite. The levels each one of them is willing to go add to the enticing story. Robert Harley, play by
    Nicholas Hoult, tries to use Fletcher to progress his own politically aspirations, ones that are in conflict
    with Weiss. Fletcher sees this opportunity to drive a wedge between Weiss and Queen Anne, joins Harley and the
    begin to work their agenda. This plan success in the end as Fletcher becomes court favorite and Harley the
    Queen’s chief minister.
    The film is a wonderfully crafted film. It is superbly written with better direction. It is unquestionably one
    of the favorites for several of the academy awards. I can easily see it being nominated for many awards and
    could easily be the favorite for all of them.

    <h2>Bird Box</h2>
   
    <p>
        Bird Box is a Netflix original movie that starts off with leaving in what you think is normal world but slowly
        but surely the world has been taken over by deepest darks fears. The movie has apocalyptic feel that was turned
        upside down. You never really no what to expect.

        I think a lot of people online calling in scary. You either hate this movie or you like it. There is no in
        between. I would describe it as freaky. Which probably wondering what I mean. The concept of walking round with
        blind fold and using your ears is strange but when you think of it because if you don’t your deepest darkest
        fear will take over and who will have no control on what you do to yourself. As I said early it takes your
        deepest and has shown you right in front of you to where end yourself. Can you image walking outside have
        deepest fear where only you can see it and then you end your life after you see it.

        Throughout entire movie you see this and how it affects people. The struggle of not able to go outside without
        blind folds and living in fear. It also shows how far will you go to keep yourself and the ones you love safe.

    I like the movie well I thought it was little strange and kind what the heck. Still overall like it but I did
    not find it scary at all. To some people it might be scary. I think overall if you watch horror films you will
    not think this movie is scary but it will give you a little of thrill just because it makes you wonder and how
    you be in that situation.

    <h2>Can you ever forgive me</h2>

    <div class="blog">
        <p>
            Lee Israel, played by Melissa McCarthy, is the driving force of the story which is based on her 2008 memoir
            of
            the same title. The complexity and fascinating details of Israel’s story help push the theme and narrative
            of
            the film. Israel, who at the time the movie begins, is no longer the renown biographer that she had once
            been.
            When we enter into her life, she is working another job to supplement her income for her cat and drinking;
            Her
            life is in shambles. She begins to forge personal letters by literary figures and sells them after
            discovering
            one on a subject that she planned her next book on.
            While this is a novel concept, what ultimately brings the audience into the movie is the character of
            Israel.
            She is a hateful women to those that she knows and down right mean to those that she doesn’t know. Israel
            is
            not a likeable character, but that’s ok, she doesn’t need to be likeable. She is relatable, but we will get
            to
            that later.

            <p>
                Israel has trouble with the existence that she has made for herself. She constantly reminisces about
                the past
                and how she was born too late. She has grown overly attached to her cat that is a gift from a past
                lover, a
                past lover that she continues to call even though the lover has moved on with their life. This really
                drives
                home what the movie is trying to capture about Israel. She is not asking us for forgiveness, she is
                asking
                herself. She can’t seem to let go of the past and this leaks into her professional life as well. She
                puts such
                a focus on writing in the style of her subjects that she doesn’t find her own style. A theme that is
                pointed to
                in her monologue near the end of the movie. She needs to accept herself and her past to be able to move
                on.
                As you can see, I have given a good deal of thought to Lee Israel and Can You Ever Forgive Me, but it
                is not
                without its flaws. I think the film fails to deliver on the strong base material that it has to work
                with. One
                flaw being an attempt to make Israel more likable in the film. She is not a likable person and doesn’t
                need to
                be presented as such. She is a very relatable character. It is easy to see ourselves in Israel. She is
                someone
                who is in a place in their life that they don’t want to be in, whether that be professionally or
                personally. We
                can relate to that and empathize with her in that way. The attempts to make her more likable undermine
                the
                plot. Another flaw is that the film seems to lose focus during some aspects of the film.

            </p>

            Ultimately, Can You Ever Forgive Me is a extremely interesting story that fails to deliver on some aspects
            of
            the film compared to the source material. It has fine acting, that will be nominated for awards in this
            coming
            awards season, but the lackluster directing will hold the movie back from what it could have been.

    <h2>The Favorite</h2>

        Setting up the background for the story will add to the richness of the film. With a war between the British
        and French as a backdrop, the story focuses on the relationship of Queen Anne and Weiss, the court’s favorite.
        Queen Anne seems to be losing herself. She doubts herself, it falling ill and becoming a mad queen. Weiss,
        being a close friend and confident, is the only one close enough to tell the queen how it is and in a brutally
        honest way. You can tell that this relationship has a very strong foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter Abigail Fletcher, played by Emma Stone, the distant cousin of Weiss, who is greeted at the door of the
        palace covered in mud after being thrown from her carriage. It would be an understatement to say that Fletcher
        was down on her luck. She coming from a similar background as Weiss, comes from nothing like it now. She has
        lost her Ladyship, due to her idiotic father’s gambling, a man that she continues to try to protect. But this
        little piece of information will be vital to understanding what drives her to do the things that she does. She
        simply wants back what was taking away from her. We learn that she can be as manipulative and conniving as
        Weiss.

    </p>

    This leads to the main drama of the film. The competition between Fletcher and Weiss on being the court
    favorite. The levels each one of them is willing to go add to the enticing story. Robert Harley, play by
    Nicholas Hoult, tries to use Fletcher to progress his own politically aspirations, ones that are in conflict
    with Weiss. Fletcher sees this opportunity to drive a wedge between Weiss and Queen Anne, joins Harley and the
    begin to work their agenda. This plan success in the end as Fletcher becomes court favorite and Harley the
    Queen’s chief minister.
    The film is a wonderfully crafted film. It is superbly written with better direction. It is unquestionably one
    of the favorites for several of the academy awards. I can easily see it being nominated for many awards and
    could easily be the favorite for all of them.

    <h2>Bird Box</h2>
   
    <p>
        Bird Box is a Netflix original movie that starts off with leaving in what you think is normal world but slowly
        but surely the world has been taken over by deepest darks fears. The movie has apocalyptic feel that was turned
        upside down. You never really no what to expect.
    </p>

        I think a lot of people online calling in scary. You either hate this movie or you like it. There is no in
        between. I would describe it as freaky. Which probably wondering what I mean. The concept of walking round with
        blind fold and using your ears is strange but when you think of it because if you don’t your deepest darkest
        fear will take over and who will have no control on what you do to yourself. As I said early it takes your
        deepest and has shown you right in front of you to where end yourself. Can you image walking outside have
        deepest fear where only you can see it and then you end your life after you see it.

        Throughout entire movie you see this and how it affects people. The struggle of not able to go outside without
        blind folds and living in fear. It also shows how far will you go to keep yourself and the ones you love safe.
    </p>


    I like the movie well I thought it was little strange and kind what the heck. Still overall like it but I did
    not find it scary at all. To some people it might be scary. I think overall if you watch horror films you will
    not think this movie is scary but it will give you a little of thrill just because it makes you wonder and how
    you be in that situation.
